üéØ Fake Login Page ‚Äì Phishing Awareness Simulation
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Role: Frontend Developer | Cybersecurity Learner

As a part of my cybersecurity learning path, I developed a simulated phishing login page to understand how attackers clone legitimate websites (like Facebook/Gmail) to trick users into entering credentials.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project was built strictly for educational and awareness purposes, and all data was handled locally in a controlled environment.

Key Features:

Pixel-perfect clone of a popular login interface

Simulated credential capture (stored/displayed locally only)

Instant redirection to the actual login page after form submission

Helps demonstrate the risks of phishing in awareness sessions
